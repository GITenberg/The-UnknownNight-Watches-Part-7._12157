<h1>
    THE UNKNOWN
</h1>
<br /><br />
<p>
    "Handsome is as 'andsome does," said the night-watchman.  It's an old
    saying, but it's true.  Give a chap good looks, and it's precious little
    else that is given to 'im.  He's lucky when 'is good looks 'ave gorn&mdash;or
    partly gorn&mdash;to get a berth as night-watchman or some other hard and
    bad-paid job.
</p>
<p>
    One drawback to a good-looking man is that he generally marries young;
    not because 'e wants to, but because somebody else wants 'im to.  And
    that ain't the worst of it: the handsomest chap I ever knew married five
    times, and got seven years for it.  It wasn't his fault, pore chap; he
    simply couldn't say No.
</p>
<p>
    One o' the best-looking men I ever knew was Cap'n Bill Smithers, wot used
    to come up here once a week with a schooner called the Wild Rose.  Funny
    thing about 'im was he didn't seem to know about 'is good looks, and he
    was one o' the quietest, best-behaved men that ever came up the London
    river.  Considering that he was mistook for me more than once, it was
    just as well.
</p>
<p>
    He didn't marry until 'e was close on forty; and then 'e made the mistake
    of marrying a widder-woman.  She was like all the rest of 'em&mdash;only
    worse.  Afore she was married butter wouldn't melt in 'er mouth, but as
    soon as she 'ad got her "lines" safe she began to make up for it.
</p>
<p>
    For the fust month or two 'e didn't mind it, 'e rather liked being fussed
    arter, but when he found that he couldn't go out for arf an hour without
    having 'er with 'im he began to get tired of it.  Her idea was that 'e
    was too handsome to be trusted out alone; and every trip he made 'e had
    to write up in a book, day by day, wot 'e did with himself.  Even then
    she wasn't satisfied, and, arter saying that a wife's place was by the
    side of 'er husband, she took to sailing with 'im every v'y'ge.
</p>
<p>
    Wot he could ha' seen in 'er I don't know.  I asked 'im one evening&mdash;in
    a roundabout way&mdash;and he answered in such a long, roundabout way that I
    didn't know wot to make of it till I see that she was standing just
    behind me, listening.  Arter that I heard 'er asking questions about me,
    but I didn't 'ave to listen: I could hear 'er twenty yards away, and
    singing to myself at the same time.
</p>
<p>
    Arter that she treated me as if I was the dirt beneath 'er feet.  She
    never spoke to me, but used to speak against me to other people.  She was
    always talking to them about the "sleeping-sickness" and things o' that
    kind.  She said night-watchmen always made 'er think of it somehow, but
    she didn't know why, and she couldn't tell you if you was to ask her.
    The only thing I was thankful for was that I wasn't 'er husband.  She
    stuck to 'im like his shadow, and I began to think at last it was a pity
    she 'adn't got some thing to be jealous about and something to occupy her
    mind with instead o' me.
</p>
<p>
    "She ought to 'ave a lesson," I ses to the skipper one evening.  "Are you
    going to be follered about like this all your life?  If she was made to
    see the foolishness of 'er ways she might get sick of it."
</p>
<p>
    My idea was to send her on a wild-goose chase, and while the Wild Rose
    was away I thought it out.  I wrote a love-letter to the skipper signed
    with the name of "Dorothy," and asked 'im to meet me at Cleopatra's
    Needle on the Embankment at eight o'clock on Wednesday.  I told 'im to
    look out for a tall girl (Mrs. Smithers was as short as they make 'em)
    with mischievous brown eyes, in a blue 'at with red roses on it.
</p>
<p>
    I read it over careful, and arter marking it "Private," twice in front
    and once on the back, I stuck it down so that it could be blown open
    a'most, and waited for the schooner to come back.  Then I gave a van-boy
    twopence to 'and it to Mrs. Smithers, wot was sitting on the deck alone,
    and tell 'er it was a letter for Captain Smithers.
</p>
<p>
    I was busy with a barge wot happened to be handy at the time, but I 'eard
    her say that she would take it and give it to 'im.  When I peeped round
    she 'ad got the letter open and was leaning over the side to wind'ard
    trying to get 'er breath.  Every now and then she'd give another look at
    the letter and open 'er mouth and gasp; but by and by she got calmer,
    and, arter putting it back in the envelope, she gave it a lick as though
    she was going to bite it, and stuck it down agin.  Then she went off the
    wharf, and I'm blest if, five minutes arterwards, a young fellow didn't
    come down to the ship with the same letter and ask for the skipper.
</p>
<p>
    "Who gave it you?" ses the skipper, as soon as 'e could speak.
</p>
<p>
    "A lady," ses the young fellow.
</p>
<p>
    The skipper waved 'im away, and then 'e walked up and down the deck like
    a man in a dream.
</p>
<p>
    "Bad news?"  I ses, looking up and catching 'is eye.
</p>
<p>
    "No," he ses, "no.  Only a note about a couple o' casks o' soda."
</p>
<p>
    He stuffed the letter in 'is pocket and sat on the side smoking till his
    wife came back in five minutes' time, smiling all over with good temper.
</p>
<p>
    "It's a nice evening," she ses, "and I think I'll just run over to
    Dalston and see my Cousin Joe."
</p>
<p>
    The skipper got up like a lamb and said he'd go and clean 'imself.
</p>
<p>
    "You needn't come if you feel tired," she ses, smiling at 'im.
</p>
<p>
    The skipper could 'ardly believe his ears.
</p>
<p>
    "I do feel tired," he ses.  "I've had a heavy day, and I feel more like
    bed than anything else."
</p>
<p>
    "You turn in, then," she ses.  "I'll be all right by myself."
</p>
<p>
    She went down and tidied herself up&mdash;not that it made much difference to
    'er&mdash;and, arter patting him on the arm and giving me a stare that would
    ha' made most men blink, she took herself off.
</p>
<p>
    I was pretty busy that evening.  Wot with shifting lighters from under
    the jetty and sweeping up, it was pretty near ha'-past seven afore I 'ad
    a minute I could call my own.  I put down the broom at last, and was just
    thinking of stepping round to the Bull's Head for a 'arf-pint when I see
    Cap'n Smithers come off the ship on to the wharf and walk to the gate.
</p>
<p>
    "I thought you was going to turn in?" I ses.
</p>
<p>
    "I did think of it," he ses, "then I thought p'r'aps I'd better stroll as
    far as Broad Street and meet my wife."
</p>
<p>
    It was all I could do to keep a straight face.  I'd a pretty good idea
    where she 'ad gorn; and it wasn't Dalston.
</p>
<p>
    "Come in and 'ave 'arf a pint fust," I ses.
</p>
<p>
    "No; I shall be late," he ses, hurrying off.
</p>
<p>
    I went in and 'ad a glass by myself, and stood there so long thinking of
    Mrs. Smithers walking up and down by Cleopatra's Needle that at last the
    landlord fust asked me wot I was laughing at, and then offered to make me
    laugh the other side of my face.  And then he wonders why people go to
    the Albion.
</p>
<p>
    I locked the gate rather earlier than usual that night.  Sometimes if I'm
    up that end I leave it a bit late, but I didn't want Mrs. Smithers to
    come along and nip in without me seeing her face.
</p>
<p>
    It was ten o'clock afore I heard the bell go, and when I opened the
    wicket and looked out I was surprised to see that she 'ad got the skipper
    with 'er.  And of all the miserable-looking objects I ever saw in my life
    he was the worst.  She 'ad him tight by the arm, and there was a look on
    'er face that a'most scared me.
</p>
<p>
    "Did you go all the way to Dalston for her?"  I ses to 'im.
</p>
<p>
    Mrs. Smithers made a gasping sort o' noise, but the skipper didn't answer
    a word.
</p>
<p>
    She shoved him in in front of 'er and stood ever 'im while he climbed
    aboard.  When he held out 'is hand to help 'er she struck it away.
</p>
<p>
    I didn't get word with 'im till five o'clock next morning, when he came
    up on deck with his 'air all rough and 'is eyes red for want of sleep.
</p>
<p>
    "Haven't 'ad a wink all night," he ses, stepping on to the wharf.
</p>
<p>
    I gave a little cough.  "Didn't she 'ave a pleasant time at Dalston?" I
    ses.
</p>
<p>
    He walked a little further off from the ship.  "She didn't go there," he
    ses, in a whisper.
</p>
<p>
    "You've got something on your mind," I ses.  "Wot is it?"
</p>
<p>
    He wouldn't tell me at fust, but at last he told me all about the letter
    from Dorothy, and 'is wife reading it unbeknown to 'im and going to meet
    'er.
</p>
<p>
    "It was an awful meeting!"  he ses.  "Awful!"
</p>
<p>
    I couldn't think wot to make of it.  "Was the gal there, then?"  I ses,
    staring at 'im.
</p>
<p>
    "No," ses the skipper; "but I was."
</p>
<p>
    "You?"  I ses, starting back.  "You!  Wot for?  I'm surprised at you!
    I wouldn't ha' believed it of you!"
</p>
<p>
    "I felt a bit curious," he ses, with a silly sort o' smile.  "But wot I
    can't understand is why the gal didn't turn up."
</p>
<p>
    "I'm ashamed of you, Bill," I ses, very severe.
</p>
<p>
    "P'r'aps she did," he ses, 'arf to 'imself, "and then saw my missis
    standing there waiting.  P'r'aps that was it."
</p>
<p>
    "Or p'r'aps it was somebody 'aving a game with you," I ses.
</p>
<p>
    "You're getting old, Bill," he ses, very short.  "You don't understand.
    It's some pore gal that's took a fancy to me, and it's my dooty to meet
    'er and tell her 'ow things are."
</p>
<p>
    He walked off with his 'ead in the air, and if 'e took that letter out
    once and looked at it, he did five times.
</p>
<p>
    "Chuck it away," I ses, going up to him.
</p>
<p>
    "Certainly not," he ses, folding it up careful and stowing it away in 'is
    breastpocket.  "She's took a fancy to me, and it's my dooty&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>
<p>
    "You said that afore," I ses.
</p>
<p>
    He stared at me nasty for a moment, and then 'e ses: "You ain't seen any
    young lady hanging about 'ere, I suppose, Bill?  A tall young lady with a
    blue hat trimmed with red roses?"
</p>
<p>
    I shook my 'ead.
</p>
<p>
    "If you should see 'er" he ses.
</p>
<p>
    "I'll tell your missis," I ses.  "It 'ud be much easier for her to do her
    dooty properly than it would you.  She'd enjoy doing it, too."
</p>
<p>
    He went off agin then, and I thought he 'ad done with me, but he 'adn't.
    He spoke to me that evening as if I was the greatest friend he 'ad in the
    world.  I 'ad two 'arfpints with 'im at the Albion&mdash;with his missis
    walking up and down outside&mdash;and arter the second 'arf-pint he said he
    wanted to meet Dorothy and tell 'er that 'e was married, and that he
    'oped she would meet some good man that was worthy of 'er.
</p>
<p>
    I had a week's peace while the ship was away, but she was hardly made
    fast afore I 'ad it all over agin and agin.
</p>
<p>
    "Are you sure there's been no more letters?" he ses.
</p>
<p>
    "Sartain," I ses.
</p>
<p>
    "That's right," he ses; "that's right.  And you 'aven't seen her walking
    up and down?"
</p>
<p>
    "No," I ses.
</p>
<p>
    "'Ave you been on the look-out?" he ses.  "I don't suppose a nice gal
    like that would come and shove her 'ead in at the gate.  Did you look up
    and down the road?"
</p>
<p>
    "Yes," I ses.  "I've fair made my eyes ache watching for her."
</p>
<p>
    "I can't understand it," he ses.  "It's a mystery to me, unless p'r'aps
    she's been taken ill.  She must 'ave seen me here in the fust place; and
    she managed to get hold of my name.  Mark my words, I shall 'ear from her
    agin."
</p>
<p>
    "'Ow do you know?" I ses.
</p>
<p>
    "I feel it 'ere," he ses, very solemn, laying his 'and on his chest.
</p>
<p>
    I didn't know wot to do.  Wot with 'is foolishness and his missis's
    temper, I see I 'ad made a mess of it.  He told me she had 'ardly spoke a
    word to 'im for two days, and when I said&mdash;being a married man myself&mdash;
    that it might ha' been worse, 'e said I didn't know wot I was talking
    about.
</p>
<p>
    I did a bit o' thinking arter he 'ad gorn aboard agin.  I dursn't tell
    'im that I 'ad wrote the letter, but I thought if he 'ad one or two more
    he'd see that some one was 'aving a game with 'im, and that it might do
    'im good.  Besides which it was a little amusement for me.
</p>
<p>
    Arter everybody was in their beds asleep I sat on a clerk's stool in the
    office and wrote 'im another letter from Dorothy.  I called 'im "Dear
    Bill," and I said 'ow sorry I was that I 'adn't had even a sight of 'im
    lately, having been laid up with a sprained ankle and 'ad only just got
    about agin.  I asked 'im to meet me at Cleopatra's Needle at eight
    o'clock, and said that I should wear the blue 'at with red roses.
</p>
<p>
    It was a very good letter, but I can see now that I done wrong in writing
    it.  I was going to post it to 'im, but, as I couldn't find an envelope
    without the name of the blessed wharf on it, I put it in my pocket till I
    got 'ome.
</p>
<p>
    I got 'ome at about a quarter to seven, and slept like a child till
    pretty near four.  Then I went downstairs to 'ave my dinner.
</p>
<p>
    The moment I opened the door I see there was something wrong.  Three
    times my missis licked 'er lips afore she could speak.  Her face 'ad gone
    a dirty white colour, and she was leaning forward with her 'ands on her
    'ips, trembling all over with temper.
</p>
<p>
    "Is my dinner ready?"  I ses, easy-like.  "'Cos I'm ready for it."
</p>
<p>
    "I&mdash;I wonder I don't tear you limb from limb," she ses, catching her
    breath.
</p>
<p>
    "Wot's the matter?"  I ses.
</p>
<p>
    "And then boil you," she ses, between her teeth.  "You in one pot and
    your precious Dorothy in another."
</p>
<p>
    If anybody 'ad offered me five pounds to speak then, I couldn't ha' done
    it.  I see wot I'd done in a flash, and I couldn't say a word; but I kept
    my presence o' mind, and as she came round one side o' the table I went
    round the other.
</p>
<p>
    "Wot 'ave you got to say for yourself?"  she ses, with a scream.
</p>
<p>
    "Nothing," I ses, at last.  "It's all a mistake."
</p>
<p>
    "Mistake?" she ses.  "Yes, you made a mistake leaving it in your pocket;
    that's all the mistake you've made.  That's wot you do, is it, when
    you're supposed to be at the wharf?  Go about with a blue 'at with red
    roses in it!  At your time o' life, and a wife at 'ome working herself to
    death to make both ends meet and keep you respectable!"
</p>
<p>
    "It's all a mistake," I ses.  "The letter wasn't for me."
</p>
<p>
    "Oh, no, o' course not," she ses.  "That's why you'd got it in your
    pocket, I suppose.  And I suppose you'll say your name ain't Bill next."
</p>
<p>
    "Don't say things you'll be sorry for," I ses.
</p>
<p>
    "I'll take care o' that," she ses.  "I might be sorry for not saying some
    things, but I don't think I shall."
</p>
<p>
    I don't think she was.  I don't think she forgot anything, and she raked
    up things that I 'ad contradicted years ago and wot I thought was all
    forgot.  And every now and then, when she stopped for breath, she'd try
    and get round to the same side of the table I was.
</p>
<p>
    She follered me to the street door when I went and called things up the
    road arter me.  I 'ad a snack at a coffee-shop for my dinner, but I
    'adn't got much appetite for it; I was too full of trouble and finding
    fault with myself, and I went off to my work with a 'art as heavy as
    lead.
</p>
<p>
    I suppose I 'adn't been on the wharf ten minutes afore Cap'n Smithers
    came sidling up to me, but I got my spoke in fust.
</p>
<p>
    "Look 'ere," I ses, "if you're going to talk about that forward hussy
    wot's been writing to you, I ain't.  I'm sick and tired of 'er."
</p>
<p>
    "Forward hussy!"  he ses.  "Forward hussy!"  And afore I could drop my
    broom he gave me a punch in the jaw that pretty near broke it.  "Say
    another word against her," he ses, "and I'll knock your ugly 'ead off.
    How dare you insult a lady?"
</p>
<p>
    I thought I should 'ave gone crazy at fust, but I went off into the
    office without a word.  Some men would ha' knocked 'im down for it, but I
    made allowances for 'is state o' mind, and I stayed inside until I see
    'im get aboard agin.
</p>
<p>
    He was sitting on deck when I went out, and his missis too, but neither
    of 'em spoke a word.  I picked up my broom and went on sweeping, when
    suddenly I 'eard a voice at the gate I thought I knew, and in came my
    wife.
</p>
<p>
    "Ho!"  she ses, calling out.  "Ain't you gone to meet that gal at
    Cleopatra's Needle yet?  You ain't going to keep 'er waiting, are you?"
</p>
<p>
    "H'sh!"  I ses.
</p>
<p>
    "H'sh! yourself," she ses, shouting.  "I've done nothing to be ashamed
    of.  I don't go to meet other people's husbands in a blue 'at with red
    roses.  I don't write 'em love-letters, and say 'H'sh!' to my wife when
    she ventures to make a remark about it.  I may work myself to skin and
    bone for a man wot's old enough to know better, but I'm not going to be
    trod on.  Dorothy, indeed!  I'll Dorothy 'er if I get the chance."
</p>
<p>
    Mrs. Smithers, wot 'ad been listening with all her ears, jumped up, and
    so did the skipper, and Mrs. Smithers came to the side in two steps.
</p>
<p>
    "Did you say 'Dorothy,' ma'am?"  she ses to my missis.
</p>
<p>
    "I did," ses my wife.  "She's been writing to my husband."
</p>
<p>
    "It must be the same one," ses Mrs. Smithers.  "She's been writing to
    mine too."
</p>
<p>
    The two of 'em stood there looking at each other for a minute, and then
    my wife, holding the letter between 'er finger and thumb as if it was
    pison, passed it to Mrs. Smithers.
</p>
<p>
    "It's the same," ses Mrs. Smithers.  "Was the envelope marked 'Private'?"
</p>
<p>
    "I didn't see no envelope," ses my missis.  "This is all I found."
</p>
<p>
    Mrs. Smithers stepped on to the wharf and, taking 'old of my missis by
    the arm, led her away whispering.  At the same moment the skipper walked
    across the deck and whispered to me.
</p>
<p>
    "Wot d'ye mean by it?"  he ses.  "Wot d'ye mean by 'aving letters from
    Dorothy and not telling me about it?"
</p>
<p>
    "I can't help 'aving letters any more than you can," I ses.  "Now p'r'aps
    you'll understand wot I meant by calling 'er a forward hussy."

<p>
    "Fancy 'er writing to you!" he ses, wrinkling 'is forehead.  "Pph!  She
    must be crazy."
</p>
<p>
    "P'r'aps it ain't a gal at all," I ses.  "My belief is somebody is 'aving
    a game with us."
</p>
<p>
    "Don't be a fool," he ses.  "I'd like to see the party as would make a
    fool of me like that.  Just see 'im and get my 'ands on him.  He wouldn't
    want to play any more games."
</p>
<p>
    It was no good talking to 'im.  He was 'arf crazy with temper.  If I'd
    said the letter was meant for 'im he'd 'ave asked me wot I meant by
    opening it and getting 'im into more trouble with 'is missis, instead of
    giving it to 'im on the quiet.  I just stood and suffered in silence, and
    thought wot a lot of 'arm eddication did for people.
</p>
<p>
    "I want some money," ses my missis, coming back at last with Mrs.
    Smithers.
</p>
<p>
    That was the way she always talked when she'd got me in 'er power.  She
    took two-and-tenpence&mdash;all I'd got&mdash;and then she ordered me to go and get
    a cab.
</p>
<p>
    "Me and this lady are going to meet her," she ses, sniffing at me.
</p>
<p>
    "And tell her wot we think of 'er," ses Mrs. Smithers, sniffing too.
</p>
<p>
    "And wot we'll do to 'er," ses my missis.
</p>
<p>
    I left 'em standing side by side, looking at the skipper as if 'e was a
    waxworks, while I went to find a cab.  When I came back they was in the
    same persition, and 'e was smoking with 'is eyes shut.
</p>
<p>
    They went off side by side in the cab, both of 'em sitting bolt-upright,
    and only turning their 'eads at the last moment to give us looks we
    didn't want.
</p>
<p>
    "I don't wish her no 'arm," ses the skipper, arter thinking for a long
    time.  "Was that the fust letter you 'ad from 'er, Bill?"
</p>
<p>
    "Fust and last," I ses, grinding my teeth.

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted

must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked

permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

     http://www.gutenberg.net/etext06

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

     http://www.gutenberg.net/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
     http://www.gutenberg.net/2/4/6/8/24689
